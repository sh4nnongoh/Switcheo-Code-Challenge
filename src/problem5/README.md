This problem is not finished.

I am currently stuck in figuring how to debug the contract.
Since there are no token contracts available locally, the only way to test seems to be deploying onto BSC Testnet.
Even then if errors occur, I have no idea how to debug them.

Would be great to recieve some feedback on this.
