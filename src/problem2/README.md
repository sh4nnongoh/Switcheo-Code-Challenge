# My Awesome Problem 2 App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

You can view the live app [here](https://sh4nnongoh.github.io/Switcheo-Code-Challenge/).

## Test-Driven Development with RTL & Cucumber
---
Navigating to ```src/__tests__``` , one can see that the tests are written in a way that mimics the actual `User Story`. This acts as a contract between developers and the product owner as to what features have been completed, and will carry on to exist throughout the product lifecycle. There are no unit tests in this project as they do not provide any value to the product; unit tests act as a medium of communication between developers and will be dependent on internal best practices made by the team. With `React Testing Library (RTL)`, writing `User Story` tests that mimics actual user behavior is made possible, while also being able to execute as fast as how traditonal unit tests do.
